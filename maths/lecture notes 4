Today: Interpolation, Condition number (briefly)

Interpolation
- Very useful and important

Newtons method -> find zero of functions in all dimensions

Get p(x_i) = y_i function i=0,1,2,3...
This is called interpolation. 
Banks -> sell stocks, follow curve to get the "trend" of the stock market.
Use functions to get values between. 
Every measurement is expensive. That is the use of interpolation. 
You want the function derived from the data. 

There are different types of interpolations.
							use:
Polynomial interpolation --------> Computing intergrals (quadrature)
						 --------> Describe distinct data in a continual way 
P(x) = a_n*x^n + a_n-1*x^2 + ... + a_0

Why are we interesed in polynomials? They are very fascinating. 
They can describe continuous functions by finite numbers. 
Sinus and cosines are derived from polynomials (mac-laurin).
Finite constants can describe infinite ammout of data (continuous function).
The ammount of constants, n, is a finite number that can describe an infinite ammount of data. 
The finiteness of the data is whats so unique with polynomials. 
x^i -> monomial
p(x) = a_n*x^n + .. + a_0 -> polynomial

P^n Space of all polynomials of degree up to n. 
Vectors can be describe with respective scalars for the vectors in the basis. 
But the scalars are useless if the basis is not also defined. 
Number of basis elements is called a dimension. 

Basis of P^n {x^0,x^1,...,x^n} monomial basis.
P(x) = SIGMA_i a_i*x^i , coefficiant times basis element ==> Linear combination of coefficent times basis element. 

The basis element is the monomials. 
P^2 = span ({ x^0, x^1, x^2 })
		{x^0, x^1, x^2, 2x^2} -> Linearly dependent.  

Basis of P^n is linearly independent if all basis have different power. 
Input data: x/y-table (measurements) 
Outdata: Polunomial coefficients, a_n, a_n-1, ... , a_0 coefficiants of the monomials. 

Interpolation conditions:
p(x_i) = y_i, i= 0,...,n

a_n*x_0^n + a_n-1*x_o^n-1 + ... + a_0 = y_0
a_n*x_1^n + a_n-1*x_1^n-1 + ... + a_0 = y_1
.
.
.
n_n*x_n^n + a_n-1*x_n^n-1 + ... + a_0 = y_n
