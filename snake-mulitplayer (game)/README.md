# snake 2
A multiplayer version of Snake written in Python!
It is implemented using the Tkinter library.
This will run on any python 2.x interpreter. It can run with a Python 3.x verison but only if "Tkinter" in the file is renamed "tkinter" because they chose to rename it that way for Python 3.x versions.
