This repository contains code written in the spirit of learning and in appreciation for Python!
These scripts will run on a Unix machine that supports the Tkinter library. If you are on a windows machine and want to try this out, try editing the file a bit and change "Tkinter" to "tkinter" (uppercase to lowercase it..).
