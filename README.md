# Python playground

This repository contains different programs written in the spirit of learning and in appreciation for Python!
These scripts will run with a python 2.x interpreter that supports the Tkinter library. If you are on a pyhton 3.x interpreter and want to try this out, try editing the file a bit and change "Tkinter" to "tkinter" (uppercase to lowercase it..).
